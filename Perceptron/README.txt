To run the program to produce the weight vectors specified in homework 3, run
the shell script run.sh. This runs standard, voted, and averaged Perceptron and
prints the learned weight vector as well as the test error for standard and
averaged. The list of weight vecotors learned by voted Perceptron along with their
count is written to the file votedperceptron_weights.csv

The shell script runs the python script hw3_perceptron.py.

The implementations for the three Perceptron algorithms can by found in Perceptron.py
