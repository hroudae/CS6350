To run the program to produce the results and training and test errors specified in homework 4,
run the shell script run.sh. This runs primal, dual, and dual with Gaussian kernal SVM and
prints a table of values for each of the required algorithms and hyperparameters. It
also runs the kernel Perceptron algorithm with Gaussian kernel.

The shell script runs the python script hw4_svm.py.

The implementations for the three SVM algorithms and kernel Perceptron can by found in SVM.py
